1. Go to Segments â†’ Create Segment

3. Add condition: Last Purchase Date < (Today - 90 days)
4. Use AND operator to combine conditions
5. Preview audience size

**OR Logic:** Any condition can be true  
- \`inactive_days > 60 OR total_spend < 1000\` (inactive OR low-value customers)

**Complex Combinations:**
- \`(spend > 5000 AND visits < 2) OR inactive_days > 60\`
- \`(order_count >= 3 AND last_purchase > today - 30) OR total_spend > 20000\`

**Pro Tips:**
- Use parentheses to group conditions
- Preview audience after each rule change
- Test different combinations to find the right audience size
